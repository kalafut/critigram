Critigram

[Critigram Live Site](http://kalafut.github.io/critigram/)

Easily view your [Criticker](http://www.criticker.com) ratings distribution by pasting your ratings history text export into this tool.

Why?
====
Criticker is a pretty cool site, but their rating system is quirky to say the least. Ratings are normalized into 10 "Tiers" based on their distribution. If you start rating movies on a 0-10 scale that's fine, but if you later start rating on a 0-100 scale, the tiers will be messed up and show a glut of movies in the lowest bucket.

This little app will show your ratings distribution using a number of commonly-discussed ratings schemes.
